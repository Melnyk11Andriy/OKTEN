            In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology">Greek mythology</a>, Panacea (Greek Πανάκεια,
            Panakeia) was a goddess of universal remedy and the
            daughter of Asclepius and Epione. Panacea and her four sisters each performed a facet of Apollo's
            art:[1]

                Panacea also had four brothers—Podaleirus, one of the two kings of Tricca, who was skilled in
                diagnostics, and Machaon, the other king of Tricca, who was a master surgeon (these two took part in
                the Trojan War until Machaon was killed by Penthesilea, queen of the Amazons); Telesphoros, who
                devoted his life to serving Asclepius; and Aratus, her half-brother, who was a Greek hero and the
                patron/liberator of Sicyon. However, portrayals of the family were not consistent; Panacea and her
                sisters each at times appear as Asclepius' wife instead.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
                Panacea may have been an independent goddess before being absorbed into the Asclepius myth.[1]

            <p>
                Panacea traditionally had a poultice or potion with which she healed the sick.[citation needed] This
                brought about the concept of the panacea in medicine, a substance meant to cure all diseases. The
                term is also used figuratively as meaning "Something used to solve all problems".[3]

                A river in Thrace/Moesia took its name from the goddess, and is still known in modern Bulgaria as
                the river Zlatna Panega ("Golden Panega", from Greek panakeia).
